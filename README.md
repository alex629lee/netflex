Site-wide thematic styling provides the comfort of a traditional Netflix clone, and the high-octane energy of America's most nostalgic decade. Throughout, one will find our elements are similar, but different-- starting with the background montage on the login page, all the way through button indicators, so a user can save a video!

Users who sign up for our service can browse and watch a variety of videos from different thematic categories, like Jazzercise or Hula Hoop. They can save favorites to a list, and then remove those movies, from that list, at the push of a button! Users can also search through our video database via the nav bar; we'll begin our search as soon as you start typing!

To keep our users interested, dynamic movie segments have been built into our pages with AWS. Longer, selectable, videos have been embedded to save on overall project costs. Start watching with one click!
